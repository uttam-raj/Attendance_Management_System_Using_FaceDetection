# Attendance_Management_System_Using_FaceDetection
This project is an Attendance Management System that uses face detection to mark attendance.The system captures images, detects faces, and recognizes individuals in real-time using a combination of machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.

# Technologies Used.
Python: Core programming language
Tkinter: GUI framework for building the user interface
OpenCV: For image processing and face detection
Haar Cascade: For face detection
KNN and SVM: For machine learning-based classification
CNN Model: For deep learning-based face recognition
XAMPP: For MySQL database to store attendance records
